# Multi-Agent Reasoning RAG (Cohere-Powered)

This project implements a conversational Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to refine reasoning through iterative feedback and agent collaboration.

Built using:
- ğŸ§  **Cohere's Command-R+ and Embed V3 models**
- ğŸ§¬ **Modular agent roles for enhanced reasoning**
- ğŸ“£ **User critique integration to improve logical clarity and precision**

The system features four specialized agents:
- **Thinker**: Generates reasoning steps based on context
- **Checker**: Critiques for logic, accuracy, and clarity
- **Learner**: Refines responses using critique
- **Coordinator**: Manages context retrieval and loop control

> ğŸ’¡ **Code and architecture will be uploaded soon.**
